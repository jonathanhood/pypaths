        =====================

        PyPaths is a small library useful for computing paths across simple in-memory graphs. Try it out by installing with pip::
        
          > pip install pypaths
        
        Or, alternatively, install from source::
        
          > git clone https://github.com/jonathanhood/pypaths.git
          > cd pypaths
          > python setup.py install
        
        For the simplest default case, usage is very simple:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
          from pypaths import astar
          
          finder = astar.pathfinder()
          
          print finder( (0,0), (2,2) )
        
        We can also provide some parameters to help the algoriths understand your specific graph:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
          from pypaths import astar
          
          finder = astar.pathfinder( 
                            distance=my_distance_function,           # Calculate the absolute distance between two nodes
                            cost=my_cost_function,                   # Calculate the heuristic cost between nodes
                            neighbors=my_neighbors_function)         # Calculate the list of neighbors for a given node
          
          print finder( "MY NODE 1", "MY NODE 3" )
