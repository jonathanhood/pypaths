"""
The pathfinding module can be used to find the shortest
path between two points in a graph.

To use the pathfinder for the default case:

>>> finder = pathfinder()
>>> finder( (0,0), (1,1) )
(2, [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)])

Or, to customize the pathfinder via passed in functions to handle for your
particular graph implementation:

>>> finder = pathfinder( distance=absolute_distance,        \\
...                      cost=fixed_cost(2),                \\
...                      neighbors=grid_neighbors(10,10) );
>>> finder( (0,0), (2,2) )
(8, [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)])

If a maximum cost is specified, then an empty path will be returned if
the cost exceeded the specified maximum

>>> finder( (0,0), (2,2), 7 )
